                        <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                        <p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. 
                              It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family.
                        </p>
                             <p>Koalas have strong, razor-sharp claws that can cause severe injuries. They can also bite tremendously hard. 
                                   Although they may appear docile, they are capable of lashing out very quickly when threatened. 
                                   Even very sick koalas can react aggressively when handled.
                              </p>

                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the koalas at pen K22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
