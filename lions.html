                        <h3>LIONS</h3>
                        <p>The lion is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. 
                              It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
                              It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane.
                        </p>
                             <p>Because prey is sparse in the desert regions, lions have to search far and wide for food and live off smaller prey, such as antelope, mice and birds. 
                                   The lions have a stronger resistance to thirst and can go for up to two weeks without drinking water (they rely on their prey's blood for moisture).
                              </p>

                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the lions at pen L24, right next to the pizza shop.</p>
