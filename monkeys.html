                        <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                        <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals, in part, the simians of infraorder Simiiformes. 
                              The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys.
                        </p>
                             <p>The monkeys in tourist areas are accustomed to interactions with humans and may even appear friendly, but sometimes the situation can change quickly.
                                   The larger, gray-haired monkeys are often the most likely to turn aggressive if they feel their status as alpha is threatened.
                              </p>

                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the monkeys at pen M14, right next to the monkey trail.</p>
