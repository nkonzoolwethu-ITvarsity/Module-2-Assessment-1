                        <h3>PHANDAS</h3>
                        <p>The giant panda, also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to south central China. 
                              It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. 
                              The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.
                        </p>
                             <p>No matter how many adorable videos you've seen of pandas, don't approach a giant panda in the wild. 
                                   They have strong grips and can deliver powerful bites that are strong enough to harm a human leg.
                              </p>

                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the pandas at pen P18, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
