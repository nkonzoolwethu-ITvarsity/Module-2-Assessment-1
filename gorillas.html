                        <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                        <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forest of central Sub-Saharan Africa. 
                              The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or five subspecies. 
                              They are the largest living primates.
                        </p>
                             <p>Gorillas are generally known to be gentle, peaceful and friend primates, and that the mere fact that they share 98% of their DNA with human beings only proves that they are more like us. 
                                   Gorillas are social animals and only become aggressive towards humans when they feel threatened.
                              </p>

                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the gorillas at pen G33, right next to the Insect House.</p>
