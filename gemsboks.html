                        <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                        <p>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. 
                              It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. 
                              Some authorities formerly included the East African as a subspecies.
                        </p>
                             <p>Physical: The gemsbok is a large antelope of striking appearance with long spear-like horns.
                                   The only outward difference between males and females is their horns. For this reason, many hunters mistake females for males each year.
                              </p>

                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
